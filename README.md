# Eioku - Video Intelligence Platform

Eioku transforms your video library into a searchable database. You film it, we index it, you find it.

---

## What It Does

- **Automatic ML Analysis**: Drop videos in a folder, Eioku automatically runs:
  - Object detection (YOLO) - find every dog, car, person
  - Speech transcription (Whisper) - searchable transcripts
  - OCR (EasyOCR) - text visible in frames
  - Place recognition (Places365) - indoor/outdoor scene classification
  - Scene detection - shot boundary detection
  - Metadata extraction - EXIF timestamps, GPS, duration

- **Cross-Video Search**: Search across your entire library chronologically
  - "Find every dog scene" - jumps between videos automatically
  - Ordered by when you actually filmed (EXIF date), not upload date

- **Global Jump Navigation**: Cmd+F for your video archive
  - Next/Previous buttons navigate across all videos
  - Full-text search on transcripts and OCR text

---

## Demo Checklist

> Hackathon judges: Use the Google Drive videos from the submission, or bring your own!

1. Add videos to `test-videos/` directory (variety: dogs, people, speech, text, GPS)
2. Start the environment using the [Quick Start](#quick-start-with-docker) instructions below
3. Open http://localhost:9080
4. Wait for ML tasks to complete (check status in video player view)
5. Try features:
   - **Video Player**: Explore detected objects, transcripts, OCR, places
   - **Clip Export**: Set timestamps and download a clip
   - **Global Jump**: Search + use Previous/Next to jump across videos
   - **Artifact Gallery**: See all matches with thumbnails

### Limitations

1. **Some ML Models download per boot**: Each time the ml-service reboots, it may download some YOLO models, which will delay processing for up to a minute or so (I missed this during the build process >:|)
2. **Video discovery**: Videos are only discovered when the backend starts - no hot-reload for new files
3. **Face search**: Face detection runs but face search/clustering is not implemented yet
4. **No combined filters**: Global jump searches one artifact type at a time (can't search "dog AND tokyo")
5. **Single language OCR**: OCR is configured for English only
6. **No semantic search**: Text search is exact match only - no embeddings or similarity search yet
7. **Transcription language**: Whisper auto-detects language but works best with English
8. **GPS reverse geocoding**: Requires internet connection for location names
9. **Large video files**: Very long videos (>1hr) may timeout during processing
10. **No search suggestions**: No aggregation of available labels/terms - users must guess what to search for -- you
can view individual videos to get an idea for what does
exist, but it's far from ideal (e.g., no "show me all detected objects or spoken words")

---

## Quick Start with Docker

> Important: the ml-service image is very large due to containing
> ML models (~10GB). It may take a while to pull depending on your
> network.

> Important: the images are only built for `amd64`, so expect
> slower performance on Apple Silicon + Rosetta2.

Two deployment options are available depending on your hardware:

### GPU (CUDA) - Recommended for NVIDIA GPUs

For systems with NVIDIA GPUs and the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) installed:

```bash
# Start with GPU acceleration (~10x faster ML processing)
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.cuda.yml up

# Access the app
open http://localhost:9080
```

### CPU - For Apple Silicon or systems without NVIDIA GPU

For Mac (Apple Silicon), Windows without NVIDIA GPU, or Linux without CUDA:

```bash
# Start with CPU-only processing (slower but universal)
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.cpu.yml up

# Access the app
open http://localhost:9080
```

> **Note for Apple Silicon users**: Use the CPU environment. The CUDA environment requires NVIDIA GPUs which are not available on Apple hardware. MPS is not supported in docker containers, and I did not have time to create a non-docker environment for the demo.

### Stopping and Cleaning Up

```bash
# Stop the environment
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.cuda.yml down
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.cpu.yml down

# Stop and remove all data (fresh start)
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.cuda.yml down -v
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.cpu.yml down -v
```

### Performance Comparison

Benchmark on 13 test videos (557 MB total, 2.5-275 MB each):

| Environment | Hardware | Tasks | Duration | Rate |
|-------------|----------|-------|----------|------|
| Docker CUDA | RTX 3070 Ti (8GB) | 130 | 9 min 9 sec | ~14.2 tasks/min |
| Docker CPU | Ryzen 9 5900X | 80 | 1 hr 7 min | ~1.2 tasks/min |

GPU is roughly **10-12x faster** than CPU for ML processing.

### Specs (7 features)

> Note: the architecture for this project evolved a lot as I made progress. Review
> those changes here: [Architecture Evolution](./changes.md).

Each feature was designed using Kiro's requirements → design → tasks workflow.
I made extensive use of the [principal-software-engineer.agent](.kiro/prompts/principal-software-engineer.agent.md) for software architecture decisions
and code reviews.
